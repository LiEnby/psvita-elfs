		<h2>GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h2>
		<p>Version 2, June 1991</p>
		
		<p>Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
		51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
		Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
		of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
		
		<p>[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
		numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]</p>
		
		<p>Preamble</p>
		
		<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
		freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
		Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
		free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
		
		<p>This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
		specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
		other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
		your libraries, too.</p>
		
		<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
		price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
		have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
		this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
		if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
		in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
		
		<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
		anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
		These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
		you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.</p>
		
		<p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
		or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
		you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
		code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
		complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
		with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
		it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
		
		<p>Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
		the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
		permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>
		
		<p>Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
		that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
		library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
		want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
		version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
		the original authors' reputations.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
		patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
		software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
		transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
		we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
		free use or not licensed at all.</p>
		
		<p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
		GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
		license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
		designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
		one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
		the same as in the ordinary license.</p>
		
		<p>The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
		they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
		program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
		changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
		analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
		a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
		derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
		treats it as such.</p>
		
		<p>Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
		Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
		sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
		concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.</p>
		
		<p>However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
		users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
		libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
		permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
		preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
		libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
		this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
		changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
		will lead to faster development of free libraries.</p>
		
		<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
		modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
		"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
		former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
		works together with the library.</p>
		
		<p>Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
		General Public License rather than by this special one.</p>
		
		<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
		
		<p>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
		contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
		party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
		General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
		addressed as "you".</p>
		
		<p>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
		prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
		(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>
		
		<p>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
		which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
		Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
		copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
		portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
		straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
		included without limitation in the term "modification".)</p>
		
		<p>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
		making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
		all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
		interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
		and installation of the library.</p>
		
		<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
		covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
		running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
		such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
		on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
		writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
		and what the program that uses the Library does.</p>
		
		<p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
		complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
		you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
		appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
		all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
		warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
		Library.</p>
		
		<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
		and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
		fee.
		
		<p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
		of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
		distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
		above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
		
    <p>a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>
		
    <p>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
		
    <p>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
		
    <p>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.</p>
		
    <p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)</p>
		
		<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
		identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
		and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
		themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
		sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
		distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
		on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
		this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
		entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
		it.</p>
		
		<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
		your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
		exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
		collective works based on the Library.</p>
		
		<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
		with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
		a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
		the scope of this License.</p>
		
		<p>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
		License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
		this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
		that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
		instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
		ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
		that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
		these notices.</p>
		
		<p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
		that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
		subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>
		
		<p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
		the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>
		
		<p>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
		derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
		under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
		it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
		must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
		medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>
		
		<p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
		from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
		source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
		distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
		compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
		
		<p>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
		Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
		linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
		work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
		therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>
		
		<p>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
		creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
		contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
		library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
		Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
		
		<p>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
		that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
		derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
		Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
		linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
		threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
		
		<p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
		structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
		functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
		file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
		work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
		Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>
		
		<p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
		distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
		Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
		whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p>
		
		<p>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
		link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
		work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
		under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
		modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
		engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>
		
		<p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
		Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
		this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
		during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
		copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
		directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
		of these things:</p>
		
    <p>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)</p>
		
    <p>b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.</p>
		
    <p>c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.</p>
		
    <p>d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>
		
		<p>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
		Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
		reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
		the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
		distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
		components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
		which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
		the executable.</p>
		
		<p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
		restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
		accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
		use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
		distribute.</p>
		
		<p>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
		Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
		facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
		library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
		the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
		permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>
		
    <p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.</p>
		
    <p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
		
		<p>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
		the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
		attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
		distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
		rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
		or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
		terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
		
		<p>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
		signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
		distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
		prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
		modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
		Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
		all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
		the Library or works based on it.</p>
		
		<p>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
		Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
		original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
		subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
		restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
		You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
		this License.</p>
		
		<p>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
		infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
		conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
		otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
		excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
		distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
		License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
		may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
		license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
		all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
		the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
		refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>
		
		<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
		particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
		and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
		
		<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
		patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
		such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
		integrity of the free software distribution system which is
		implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
		generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
		through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
		system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
		to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
		impose that choice.</p>
		
		<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
		be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
		
		<p>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
		certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
		original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
		an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
		so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
		excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
		written in the body of this License.</p>
		
		<p>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
		versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
		Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
		but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
		
		<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
		specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
		"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
		conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
		the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
		license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
		the Free Software Foundation.</p>
		
		<p>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
		programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
		write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
		copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
		Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
		decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
		of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
		and reuse of software generally.</p>
		
		<p>NO WARRANTY</p>
		
		<p>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
		WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
		EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
		OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
		KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
		IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
		PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
		LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
		THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
		
		<p>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
		WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
		AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
		FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
		CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
		LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
		RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
		FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
		SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
		DAMAGES.</p>
		
		<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
		
		<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p>
		
		<p>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
		possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
		everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
		redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
		ordinary General Public License).</p>
		
		<p>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
		safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
		convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
		"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
		
    <p>&lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</p>

			<h2>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h2>
			<p>Version 2.1, February 1999</p>
			
			<p>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
			51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
			Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
			of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
			
			<p>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
			as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
			the version number 2.1.]</p>
			
			<p>Preamble</p>
			
			<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
			freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
			Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
			free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
			
			<p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
			specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
			Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
			can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
			this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
			strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>
			
			<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
			not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
			you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
			for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
			it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
			it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
			these things.</p>
			
			<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
			distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
			rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
			you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>
			
			<p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
			or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
			you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
			code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
			complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
			with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
			it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
			
			<p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
			library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
			permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>
			
			<p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
			there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
			modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
			that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
			author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
			introduced by others.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
			any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
			effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
			restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
			any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
			consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>
			
			<p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
			ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
			General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
			is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
			this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
			libraries into non-free programs.</p>
			
			<p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
			a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
			combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
			General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
			entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
			Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
			the library.</p>
			
			<p>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
			does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
			Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
			of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
			are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
			libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
			special circumstances.</p>
			
			<p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
			encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
			a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
			allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
			library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
			case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
			software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p>
			
			<p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
			programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
			free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
			non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
			operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
			system.</p>
			
			<p>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
			users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
			linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
			that program using a modified version of the Library.</p>
			
			<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
			modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
			"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
			former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
			be combined with the library in order to run.</p>
			
			<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
			
			<p>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
			program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
			other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
			this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
			Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
			
			<p>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
			prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
			(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>
			
			<p>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
			which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
			Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
			copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
			portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
			straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
			included without limitation in the term "modification".)</p>
			
			<p>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
			making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
			all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
			interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
			and installation of the library.</p>
			
			<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
			covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
			running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
			such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
			on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
			writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
			and what the program that uses the Library does.</p>
			
			<p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
			complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
			you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
			appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
			all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
			warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
			Library.</p>
			
			<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
			and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
			fee.</p>
			
			<p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
			of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
			distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
			above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
			
			<p>a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>
			
			<p>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
			stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
			
			<p>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
			charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
			
			<p>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
			table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
			the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
			is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
			in the event an application does not supply such function or
			table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
			its purpose remains meaningful.</p>
			
			<p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
			a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
			application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
			application-supplied function or table used by this function must
			be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
			root function must still compute square roots.)</p>
			
			<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
			identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
			and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
			themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
			sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
			distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
			on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
			this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
			entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
			it.</p>
			
			<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
			your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
			exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
			collective works based on the Library.</p>
			
			<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
			with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
			a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
			the scope of this License.</p>
			
			<p>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
			License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
			this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
			that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
			instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
			ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
			that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
			these notices.</p>
			
			<p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
			that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
			subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>
			
			<p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
			the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>
			
			<p>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
			derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
			under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
			it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
			must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
			medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>
			
			<p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
			from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
			source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
			distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
			compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
			
			<p>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
			Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
			linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
			work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
			therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>
			
			<p>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
			creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
			contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
			library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
			Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
			
			<p>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
			that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
			derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
			Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
			linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
			threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
			
			<p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
			structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
			functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
			file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
			work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
			Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>
			
			<p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
			distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
			Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
			whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p>
			
			<p>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
			link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
			work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
			under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
			modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
			engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>
			
			<p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
			Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
			this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
			during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
			copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
			directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
			of these things:</p>
			
			<p>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
			machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
			changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
			Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
			with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
			uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
			user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
			executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
			that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
			Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
			to use the modified definitions.)</p>
			
			<p>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
			Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
			copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
			rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
			will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
			the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
			interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
			
			<p>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
			least three years, to give the same user the materials
			specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
			than the cost of performing this distribution.</p>
			
			<p>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
			from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
			specified materials from the same place.</p>
			
			<p>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
			materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>
			
			<p>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
			Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
			reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
			the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
			normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
			components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
			which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
			the executable.</p>
			
			<p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
			restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
			accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
			use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
			distribute.</p>
			
			<p>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
			Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
			facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
			library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
			the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
			permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>
			
			<p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
			based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
			facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
			Sections above.</p>
			
			<p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
			that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
			where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
			
			<p>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
			the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
			attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
			distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
			rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
			or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
			terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
			
			<p>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
			signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
			distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
			prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
			modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
			Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
			all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
			the Library or works based on it.</p>
			
			<p>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
			Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
			original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
			subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
			restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
			You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
			this License.</p>
			
			<p>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
			infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
			conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
			otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
			excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
			distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
			License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
			may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
			license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
			all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
			the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
			refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
			
			<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
			particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
			and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
			
			<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
			patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
			such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
			integrity of the free software distribution system which is
			implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
			generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
			through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
			system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
			to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
			impose that choice.</p>
			
			<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
			be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
			
			<p>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
			certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
			original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
			an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
			so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
			excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
			written in the body of this License.</p>
			
			<p>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
			versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
			Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
			but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
			
			<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
			specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
			"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
			conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
			the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
			license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
			the Free Software Foundation.</p>
			
			<p>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
			programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
			write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
			copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
			Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
			decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
			of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
			and reuse of software generally.</p>
			
			<p>NO WARRANTY</p>
			
			<p>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
			WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
			EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
			OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
			KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
			IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
			PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
			LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
			THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
			
			<p>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
			WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
			AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
			FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
			CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
			LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
			RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
			FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
			SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
			DAMAGES.</p>
			
			<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
			
			<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p>
			
			<p>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
			possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
			everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
			redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
			ordinary General Public License).</p>
			
			<p>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
			safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
			convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
			"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
			
			<p>&lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</p>
				<p>Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</p>
				
				<p>This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

				<p>This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
				but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

				<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
				
				<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
